### Multi-System Anatomical Visualization with Advanced Rendering & Navigation

This project provides an **interactive 3D visualization tool** for exploring four major human anatomical systems:
- **Nervous System**
- **Musculoskeletal System**
- **Dental System**
- **Cardiovascular System**

It integrates **three visualization methods** and **dynamic navigation features**, making it an ideal educational and research-oriented platform.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🩺 Anatomical Systems
- **Nervous System** – explore brain structures.  
- **Musculoskeletal System** – visualize bones, muscles, and joints.  
- **Dental System** – view detailed oral and jaw anatomy.  
- **Cardiovascular System** – includes **animated heart pumping** and vessel dynamics.  

---

### 🎨 Visualization Techniques
1. **Clipping Planes** – slice through models to view internal layers.  
2. **Surface Rendering** – realistic anatomical surfaces and textures.  
3. **Curved MPR (Multi-Planar Reconstruction)** – follow curved paths through anatomical volumes with full control.

---

### 🧭 Navigation & Interaction
- **Focus Navigation** – quickly zoom to target organs or systems.  
- **Flying Camera** – smooth cinematic transitions through anatomy.  
- **Curved Path Control** – interactively adjust MPR trajectory.  
- **Heart Animation** – dynamic real-time cardiac cycle simulation.
